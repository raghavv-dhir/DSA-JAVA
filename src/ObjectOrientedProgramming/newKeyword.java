/*
Important theory related to "new" keyword

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation: The new keyword allocates memory on the heap dynamically. It ensures objects are created during runtime with required initialization.

2. Constructor Invocation: After memory allocation, the constructor is called to initialize the object.

3. Default Initialization: Without a constructor, the objectâ€™s properties are initialized to their default values (e.g., null for objects, 0 for integers).

4. Garbage Collection: Objects created with new remain in memory until no reference points to them, after which they are eligible for garbage collection.
